# Doctor Appointment Booking System
# Overview
The Doctor Appointment Booking System is a backend application that facilitates booking and managing appointments between doctors and patients. The system is designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that patients can book, view, modify, and cancel appointments effortlessly. This system is useful for clinics and hospitals to organize appointments and manage doctor availability efficiently.

# Theoretical Concepts and Design
# 1. Core Functionalities
The system provides the following core functionalities:

Appointment Booking: Allows patients to schedule appointments with available doctors within a specified time slot.
View Appointments: Enables patients to view their scheduled appointments or view all appointments for a specific doctor.
Modify Appointment: Gives patients the flexibility to reschedule their appointments to a different time slot.
Cancel Appointment: Enables patients to cancel their scheduled appointments, freeing up the slot for others.
# 2. Entities and Data Structure
The system revolves around two main entities:

Patient: Represents the user booking the appointment, including details such as first name, last name, and email.
Doctor: Represents the medical professional with predefined availability slots.
Each appointment stores the following information:

Patient details (first name, last name, email).
Doctorâ€™s name.
Appointment time slot (e.g., "10:00 AM - 11:00 AM").
# 3. RESTful API Design
The backend is built using RESTful APIs, which follow standard HTTP methods such as:

POST: For creating a new resource (e.g., booking an appointment).
GET: For retrieving data (e.g., viewing appointments).
PUT: For updating a resource (e.g., modifying an appointment).
DELETE: For deleting a resource (e.g., cancelling an appointment).
